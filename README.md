# Mods-for-Icarus-Solo
A collection of mods created by Rhayvenwolf-Howler, for the survival game Icarus on Solo only. I will give credit where it is due specially if an inspiration for a mods is used or a mod that has been given with permission to use.
Rhayvenwolf-Soy&CoconutMilk_v1_w195 Rhayvenwolf's Soy & Coconut Milk Mod for v 1.0 for Week 195 and All versions of Icarus (9/10/2025) On prospect will allow the player to create Milk using soy beans and mature coconut's to make milk in the stoves you create. The mod was made in week 197 but works on all weeks version of the game, unless something drastically changes with the loadout slots in the game. Thanks to S Gamez on Discord a fellow modder for allowing me to use part of his mod to create just the milk aspect of a mod. Thanks friend you are a gem amongst modders. I offered to rename the mod from the original name at his request and I am happy to do so, hence the name.
